# Q1. Load releant libraries
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Packages
library(tidyverse) #Loading Tidyverse package in the notebook
library(haven) #for read_dta function. Importing a .dta file
```

# Q2. Import Data
```{r}
#importing dataset from the folder "Data"
mto_data <- haven::read_dta("Data/mto_sci_puf_cells_20130206.dta") 
#acquired from http://data.nber.org/mtopuf/#PUF
```

# Q3. RMarkdown formatting.
## Demonstrating two lines of Header! (first line)
### Second line 

**This phrase is in bold format**  

* Example of an unordered list
* No numbers, just bullet points
  + adding sub-item to the second bullet point
  + etc...  
  
1. Example of an ordered list
2. List is numbered instead of bullets
    a. Ordered sub-item
    b. etc...  
  
# Adding an image

# Example of Inline code
Inserting an inline code using the tick mark followed by "r" which executes the
inline code function embedded in Rstudio. In this example I have inserted the 
date and time. The current date and time is `r Sys.time()`.  


# Q4. Workflow: Basics
```{r}

my_variable <- 10
#my_varıable <- commented out because it wont execute the knit process
```
my_variable is found because of "i". Characters are different hence Rstudio 
only recognizes "my_variable" with a value of 10. "my_varıable" is not a value
mentioned or stored before.  


# Q5. Workflow: scripts.
I was not aware of the option that lets us have multple windown open. The images
attached shows the icon I used to open multiple windows.
The option circled in red in the image is used to open multiple windows of the
same Rproject. Image two shows the result.

# Q6. Research Ethics
I belive the **fifth Circle: Creative Use of Outliers** will be hardest one to
comprehend. Researchers and scholars may have different understandings for what 
qualifies to be removed from the analysis. It is widely accepted to remove
participants who provide the same response to every stimuli.  

I believe we can also remove participants who fail all the attention checks. But,
I'm not sure if that's a clever option. Also, if they provide totally nonsensical
response (ex. "apple" as response when their age was the appropriate response),
can that data point or the participant responses be removed?
